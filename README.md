# Data-Science-Assignment
# Overview
The goal of this assignment is to predict category for the given Twitter post. The categories can be: __(A) Political (B) Finance (C) Journal__. The dataset was small (just around 500 example) and the data within it was skewed, which greatly impacted on the difficulty of building good classifier. After creating a lot of custom features, using _bag-of-words_ and applying the logistic regression, the classification accuracy at level of 51% was achieved.
